# Orbit Signal

Orbit Signal is a static web app which allows users to quickly add multiple activities into their [Orbit](https://orbit.love) workspace. It is a lightweight improvement on badge scanning applications

On first load, users must provide their workspace name and api token, which is held in localStorage only. Theyr also provide an activity type and activity title. Then, they can fill in as much information as possible for a given member and submit acticities quickly. 

## Set Up

```
git clone https://github.com/phazonoverload/orbit-signal.git
cd orbit-signal
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Improvements

- [ ] Only allow existing activity types
- [ ] Beter tag adding interface
- [ ] Scan business cards
